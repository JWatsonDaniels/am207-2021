This repo contains the final project deliverable for the Harvard course AM207 for the fall 2021 semester.
We are replicating the results from the paper: "Selective Classification Can Magnify Disparities Across Groups"
using synthetic datasets and offer evaluation and commentary of the results discussed in the paper.

The Jupyter Notebook titled "selective_classification.ipynb" contains our work.
